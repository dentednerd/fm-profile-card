### What I learned

React is *massive overkill* for this project, but I had my reasons for using it. Sass would have been cleaner.

Getting the background circles to be correctly responsive was a huge pain, but in the end it was as simple as keeping the image sizes static at 800px each. That'll teach me to overthink things.

### Continued development

Why did I use React for such a simple project? It's part of a bigger future project.
